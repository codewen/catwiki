# CatWiki

This is a basic template to get you started with the CatWiki challenge.
It contains a frontend and a backend, with some very basic interaction
between them. Feel free to modify whatever you wish, or to start 
completely from scratch! :smiley_cat:

## Starting the backend

To start up the backend Node.js server, run the following command in your
terminal (note: you'll need to have Node v16.x or above installed):

```
npm start
```

The server will run on port 3001 by default. You can test it by running
something like this:

```
curl localhost:3001/api
{"message":"Hello from CatWiki!"}
```

## Starting the frontend

Open a new tab, and run the following commands in your terminal:

```
cd client
npm start
```

This should open up a new page in your default web browser at `localhost:3000`.
At this point, you should see the placeholder CatWiki app homepage.

## Running frontend tests

From the `client` directory, run the following:

```
npm test
```

This will run the test suite for you.

## Deploying to Heroku

First, make sure you have a Heroku account, and have successfully logged
in to Heroku on the command line via `heroku login`.

You'll need to create a new Heroku app (if you haven't already). You can
do this with the following (replace `${insert-your-app-name-here}` with the
word `catwiki` followed by your actual name, e.g. `catwiki-johnsmith`):

```
heroku app:create ${insert-your-app-name-here}
```

Next we need to add a Git remote for Heroku and commit any changes:

```
heroku git:remote -a ${insert-your-app-name-here}
git add .
git commit -am "Deploy app to Heroku"
```

Finally we can push our code to the Heroku remote, which will automatically
build and run our app for us. 

```
git push heroku master
```

You'll then be able to access your app at 
`http://${insert-your-app-name-here}.herokuapp.com`! :tada:

## Pushing changes to your GitHub repository

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:${your-github-username}/catwiki.git
git push origin master
```


## Challenge

Challenge: Create a CatWiki app.


Weâ€™d like you to build us a full-stack web app to look up different breeds of cats. At a minimum, your app should be able to serve up a single page with some basic information about cats (with pictures of course!). 


As a guide, you should look to spend about 90 minutes on this challenge. Submissions which are well-structured but implement fewer features are likely to score higher than submissions which are poorly structured but implement everything!


Weâ€™d like you to use GitHub to version your code. Weâ€™re looking for a clear, logical commit history that shows us the stages you went through while you were working on your app.


Weâ€™d also like you to deploy your app to onrender  (or similar cloud platform) so that we can take a look at what youâ€™ve built! We just canâ€™t get enough of those sweet, sweet kitty pics. ðŸ˜¸


Please fork the following GitHub repository and use it as a starting point: https://github.com/blowfishstudios/catwiki. You are more than welcome to change this template as you wish - but please avoid copying existing CatWiki solutions, those are easy to spot!


Use the Cat API   https://developers.thecatapi.com/view-account/ylX4blBYT9FaoVd6OhvR?report=bOoHBz-8t     to complete this challenge. The client-side should not use the API directly. Everything should be handled on the server-side. For example, searching for a cat breed should send the search query to your backend, and your backend should then call the Cat API.


Here are the user stories you might want to implement:


User story: I can search for cat breeds from the homepage and select a breed of my choice from a list

User story: I can see more photos of the breed on the breed details page

User story: I can see the breed details including description, temperament, origin, life span, adaptability, affection level, child-friendly, grooming, intelligence, health issues, social needs, stranger friendly

User story: I can see the top 10 most searched cat breeds on the homepage


Again, we donâ€™t recommend you try to implement all of these, we donâ€™t want you spending days on this! Just do your best, and keep in mind all your knowledge about clean coding, code hygiene, unit testing, TDD etc.


Weâ€™d like your frontend to look nice, but donâ€™t worry too much about styling. Here are some ideas of what the CatWiki app might look like (but yours can look different to this):





When you submit, please include your GitHub link and a live link to your running app, along with a short description of what youâ€™ve done (ideally in the README.md file). If you have any questions, please feel free to shoot them over to us.


We look forward to seeing your app! ðŸ˜€
